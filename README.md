# Module-6-Challenge
In this repository you will find a .ipynb file named SanFrancisco Housing, in this file we are a analyst at a proptech companythat wants to offer an instant, one-click service for people to buy properties and then rent them. My job is to use data visualization skills,interactive visualizations, and geospatial analysis, to find properties in the San Francisco market that are viable investment opportunities. 

# Part 1 Calculate and Plot the Housing Units per Year
We will use numerical and visual aggregation to calculate the number of housing units per year, and then visualize the results as a bar chart.
We will then answer what the overall trend in housing units is over the period that i've analyzed

# Part 2 Compare the Average Sale Prices by Neighbourhood
We will use interactive visualizations and widgets to explore the average sale price per square foot by neighbourhood. 
We will then answer if the Anza Vista neighbourhood, is the average sale price per square foot for 2016 more or less than the price thatâ€™s listed for 2012?

# Part 3 Build an Interactive Neighborhood Map
We will then explore the geospatial relationships in the data by using interactive visualizations with hvPlot and GeoViews to build a interactive Neighborhood map that includes the neighbourhood location data with the average prices.
We will then answer which neighbourhood has the highest gross rent, and which has the highest sale price per square foot?

# Part 4 Compose Your Data Story
Based on the visualizations that I created, i will answer the following questions:
How does the trend in rental income growth compare to the trend in sales prices? Does this same trend hold true for all the neighbourhoods across San Francisco?
What insights can you share with your company about the potential one-click, buy-and-rent strategy that they're pursuing? Do neighbourhoods exist that you would suggest for investment, and why?
